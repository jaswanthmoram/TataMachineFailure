This project aims to predict machine failures based on operational parameters collected from industrial machines. The dataset comprises 136,429 records with 14 features, including various sensor readings, machine failure types, and product specifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Dataset Overview**\n",
        "The dataset includes the following key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Operational Parameters:**\n",

        "\n",
        "### 4. **Correlation Analysis**\n",
        "A correlation heatmap was used to analyze relationships between numerical features:\n",
        "- High correlation between air and process temperature, suggesting redundancy.\n",
        "- Torque is inversely correlated with rotational speed, aligning with physical principles.\n",

        "### 5. **Failure Analysis & Trends**\n",
        "- Failure Rate by Product Type: Different machine types (L, M, H) show varying failure rates, with some more prone to failures.\n",
        "- Failure Trends Over Time: Failure rates increase with tool wear and extreme temperature values.\n",
        "- Rotational Speed & Torque Influence: Very high or very low rotational speeds lead to more failures due to operational inefficiencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Feature Selection & Model Training**\n",
        "- Selection of independent variables based on correlation analysis.\n",
        "- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets (e.g., 80-20 split).\n",
        "- Training multiple machine learning models:\n",
        "  - Logistic Regression\n",
        "  - Random Forest Classifier\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Model Performance & Evaluation Metrics**\n",
        "- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score were calculated for each model.\n",
        "- ROC Curve analysis was performed to assess classification effectiveness.\n",
        "- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression, achieving higher recall and precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
        "- GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV were used to optimize model parameters.\n",
        "- Tuning hyperparameters resulted in improved model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. **Code Quality & Documentation**\n",
        "- Commented Code: Enhances readability and understanding.\n",
        "- Proper Output Formatting: Ensures clarity in presenting results.\n",
        "- Modularity of Code: Functions were implemented for reusable and structured coding.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. **Final Summary & Conclusion**\n",
        "- Machine failures follow specific trends influenced by temperature, rotational speed, and tool wear.\n",
        "- Certain machine types are more prone to failures, highlighting the importance of machine type in predictions.\n",
        "- Tool wear is a critical failure predictor, emphasizing proactive maintenance.\n",
        "- Air and process temperature are highly correlated, allowing one to be dropped.\n",
        "- Random Forest performed better, making it the preferred choice for predictive modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "   This comprehensive EDA and predictive modeling approach provides valuable insights for failure prediction and proactive maintenance strategies in industrial settings.\n",

        "Hyperparameter tuning was performed using RandomizedSearchCV, optimizing for recall to improve failure detection. The search explored 20 random hyperparameter combinations with 3-fold cross-validation. Key parameters tuned included tree depth, number of leaves, learning rate, regularization (L1/L2), and subsampling rates. The best model was selected and evaluated, achieving significantly higher recall and overall accuracy."

        "\n",
        "Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model by comparing the number of correct predictions to the total predictions made. It is useful for assessing general performance, ensuring that both failure and non-failure cases are predicted correctly. However, in highly imbalanced datasets where failures are rare, accuracy can be misleading, as the model may achieve high accuracy by mostly predicting \"No Failure\" without actually detecting failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall (Sensitivity, True Positive Rate): Evaluates how well the model identifies actual failures by measuring the proportion of correctly predicted failures out of all actual failures. This is critical in industrial applications where missing a failure (false negative) can lead to severe consequences such as equipment damage, operational downtime, or safety risks. A high recall ensures that most failures are detected, minimizing potential business losses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Precision (Positive Predictive Value): Assesses how many of the predicted failures are actually failures. If precision is low, the model generates too many false alarms, leading to unnecessary maintenance costs, inefficient resource allocation, and potential disruptions to operations. A high precision ensures that when the model flags a failure, it is likely to be a real failure, optimizing maintenance efforts."
